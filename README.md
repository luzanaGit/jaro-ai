## Software Stack

This project leverages a modern and robust set of technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

* **Frontend**: Built with **React** and **Vite**, along with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, to provide a dynamic and responsive web interface. This ensures users can access the AI platform conveniently from any web browser.
* **Backend**: Powered by **Node.js** and **Express.js**, chosen for their flexibility and our proficiency, enabling efficient handling of API requests and server-side logic.
* **Database**: **Firestore Database** is utilized for its NoSQL capabilities and ease of integration, which aligns with our familiarity.
* **Web Server**: **Firebase Hosting** is used for deploying the application, providing a reliable and scalable hosting solution.
* **AI Models**: Integrates with **OpenRouter.AI**, leveraging their extensive collection of free AI models, allowing for diverse AI functionalities within the platform.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the JaRo AI application locally on your machine.

### Setup

1.  Go to a directory of your choice, make a folder called ```jaro-ai```, open it, click "Open in Terminal", and clone the repository (download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you haven't already!):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/luzanaGit/jaro-ai
    ```

2.  Open "Node.js command prompt" and go to the directory where you cloned the repository (download [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already!):
    <br><br>
    Example:
    If you cloned the repository to your desktop, it may be ```C:\Users\User\Desktop\jaro-ai```, in that case, after opening "Node.js command prompt", copy this:
    ```bash
    cd ".\Desktop\jaro-ai"
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified in your backend configuration).
